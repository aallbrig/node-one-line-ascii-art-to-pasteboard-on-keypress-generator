## One Line Ascii Art to Pasteboard on Keypress Generator

This application starts it a process that listens for user specified keypress sequences to generate one-line ascii art pieces into their pasteboard ("the clipboard").

This is ideal for text-based chatting with people to easily liven up the interaction.

The configuration rules can specify a keyboard sequence to either...

1. Return a specific one-line ascii art piece
1. One one-line ascii art piece from a specific categorical "topic" of one-line ascii art (e.g. "dogs" or "food and drink")
1. One randomly selected one-line ascii art piece from a randomly selected "topic" of one-line ascii art pieces

This user configuration will be handled in a config file that will work like any

### Development
1. Clone repo
1. Already have (or acquire) node, npm

### Future Development
- Allow users to specify their own categories of one-line ascii art they find while they travel across the net
